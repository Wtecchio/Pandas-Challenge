# Pandas-Challenge
This project was a demonstration of the capabilities of Jupyter notebook and Pandas DataFrames for parcing  large data sets and being able to find meaningful conclusions from the data.

**concepts utilized on the project:** <br />
using and utilizing Juypter Notebook <br />
accessing multiple csv files and exctracting data <br />
data manipulation techniques with the use of DataFrame from Pandas <br />
finding meaningful conclusions from the given data<br />
<br />

  **First opinon of settuping up the code:**
  
  This project was a good excercise to be able to create and manipulate several different Data Frames and being able to order the data into several different ways to make interesting conlcusions. This also gave an initial point in which to use Jupyter Notebook and see all the benefits of the library. This project left me confident with being able to parce through Pandas. 
  
  
  **Conclusions from the Dataset:**

  Throughout the entire data set, schools with higher per capita budgets (645-675 per student) performend much worse than their lower budget (<585 per student) counterparts.

  Also seen throughout the Data, smaller and medium sized schools performed much better than lerger sized schools on passing math (89% & 91% passing vs 67% passing)

  Charter schools also noticably outperformed public district schools, but a conflicting variable on this conclusion is that charter schools have radically smaller school populations compared to public district schools, requiring further data and anaylsis to gain more insightful knowledge
