    "Overall Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Throughout the entire data set, schools with higher per capita budgets (645-675 per student) performend much worse than their lower budget (<585 per student) counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also seen throughout the Data, smaller and medium sized schools performed much better than lerger sized schools on passing math (89% & 91% passing vs 67% passing)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Charter schools also noticably outperformed public district schools, but a conflicting variable on this conclusion is that charter schools have radically smaller school populations compared to public district schools, requiring further data and anaylsis to gain more insightful knowledge"
